## Dataset
The US Accidents dataset is large and is NOT included in this repository.
Download the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents
After downloading, place the CSV file in a local `dataset/` folder at the project root:
`RoadSafe-Analytics/dataset/US_Accidents_March23.csv`

We keep datasets out of the repo to avoid large pushes.
